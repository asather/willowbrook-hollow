## Illustration Consistency Rules
- Use **master assets only** for canon looks. Variants (seasonal outfits, props) go in `images/characters/variants/` and must not change proportions or base colors.  
- Keep lighting soft daylight; line weight and palette consistent across characters.  
- When prompting: reference the exact filename(s) and this Character Bible entry.  
- Ensure permanent accessories are always included (Brindle’s bandana, Echo’s satchel).  
- Maintain proportional scale between characters across illustrations.
