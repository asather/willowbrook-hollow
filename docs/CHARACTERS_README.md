## Character Consistency Guidelines

- Always use official **Character Bible** entries for visual and personality accuracy.  
- Permanent accessories (Brindle’s bandana, Echo’s satchel) must never be omitted or altered.  
- Dialogue style should match each character’s speech notes from the Bible (e.g., Wren’s quick, singsong repetition; Moss’s polite pauses).  
- Keep humor light‑hearted; avoid making any character the butt of mean‑spirited jokes.
