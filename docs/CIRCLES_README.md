# Willowbrook Hollow – Circle System Guide

## Purpose of the Circles
**In‑story tradition:** Circles mark growth and skill among Hollow animals.  
**Reader achievement:** Circles are reading milestones; finishing a Circle’s books unlocks the next.

Goal: deliver **skill‑appropriate** books that spark interest and **incentivize continued reading** through badges and ceremonies.
**Bio copy:** Character bios should reflect this progression. Author bios for each Circle in `/docs/character-bios.json`.

## How Circles Work in the Books
1. **Ceremony at Completion** – The final book of each Circle ends with a warm, funny gathering at the Great Oak:
   - **Acorn → Leaf:** green leaf charm.
   - **Leaf → Branch:** carved twig token.
   - **Branch → Oak:** carved acorn pendant with speeches (often comical).
   - **Oak → Elder:** rare; storytelling + a carved staff/cane.
   The reader is welcomed alongside the characters.

2. **Symbols in Illustrations** – Each Circle has a symbol (Acorn, Leaf, Branch, Oak, Elder). Symbols appear **organically** in art (carved, woven, painted)—never counted or called out.

3. **Circle Skills Drive the Plot** – Each Circle emphasizes specific skills that the character demonstrates during the story; the reader’s quiz echoes these skills.
